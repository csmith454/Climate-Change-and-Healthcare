# Climate-Change-and-Healthcare
Project completed by Cole Smith, Ritika Palacharla, and Ginger Hudson in May 2024

  This project explores the relationship between climate change (represented by average yearly temperatures) over time
  and a country's healthcare expenses to understand how changing global temperatures impact the private and domestic 
  healthcare expenditures of countries around the world and across regions as described by the World Health Organization (WHO).

  This project utilizes the WHO's Global Health Expenditure Dataset (GHED) and Berkeley Earth's global temperature dataset.  

  Our analysis was initially concerned with determining the relationship between change in average temperature globally and 
  health expenditure. After seeing the lack of consistent correlation between temperature change and health expenditure, 
  we changed our final visualization to show income groupings versus health expenditure, as we saw a greater correlation between
  these variables and could draw greater conclusions.

  Ultimately climate change is a multi-faceted issue that cannot be completely described by temperature as a single data point.  
  In the future, we would like to continue work on this project by changing the temperature variable to another variable, such 
  as the frequency of natural disasters over time, rainfall over time, or albedo measurements over time.
